Includes some tweaks from D. J. Bernstein
to fit better into eBASH and to improve portability.

*.py:
Reference Python implementation from D. J. Bernstein.
"python genmatrix.py" prints a copy of matrix.c.
"python genmatrix2.py" does the same in another way.

"python compress2.py" does the same in another way.
