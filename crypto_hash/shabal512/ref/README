This is the "optimized" implementation of SHABAL, as submitted to the
NIST SHA-3 competition, modified to fit the eBASH API. It should compile
and operate cleanly on all architectures which eBASH runs on. The code
includes some inline assembly for fast little-endian decoding of 32-bits
aligned words; this code is protected by preprocessor directives which
enable it only on those architectures and compilers which support such
inline assembly. For all other architectures and compilers, a fall-back
generic code is used.

The code is meant to be freely redistributable and modifiable. There
is no known copyright or patent infringement claim on this code and
algorithm, and no plan to establish such a patent. In the words
of the eBASH call for submission web page, this means a level 0
of copyright protection, and a level 0 of patent protection.
