This BAT is an implementation of the curve25519 key exchange cryptosystem
as described by Dan Bernstein. See http://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html for details.

The purpose is to show that on a 64-bit computer with reasonnable integer
arithmetic (Athlon64, and maybe also Intel Core2, but forget about
Pentium 4 EMT64), using integer units is faster than using the x87
coprocessor. Of course, this is a constantly evolving situation, since
new processors are released every few months.

Version 2:
Faster base field arithmetic for AMD64.
