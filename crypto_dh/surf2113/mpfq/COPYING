All the files, except those taken from the GMP distribution have been
written by Pierrick Gaudry and Emmanuel Thomé. 

Most of the important code is extracted from the MPFQ library that those two
authors are currently writing. See http://www.mpfq.org (well, empty page
for the moment!)

When this library will be in a presentable state, it will be released
under a free software license (LGPL presumably), and therefore the code
of this BAT will also be free software. But right now, please consider
that this code is non-free software (but still open-source): you are
allowed to copy, compile and use only for benchmarking purpose. And you
are allowed to modify it only to fix a bug in the benchmarking process.
If you are interested in improving the code or in using it in some other
software, please contact the authors.
