This BAT implements a key exchange based on an elliptic curve defined
over GF(2^251). The curve E is
  y^2 + xy = x^3 + A6,
where A6 is t^13 + t^9 + t^8 + t^7 + t^2 + t + 1, with t defined by
  t^251 + t^7 + t^4 + t^2 + 1.

E and its twist have almost prime cardinalities:
#E  = 4*904625697166532776746648320380374280087573892165070460659900068401211992033
#Et = 2*1809251394333065553493296640760748560239539236471126704913249363444861317183

The point with abscissa t^3+1 is taken as base point.

The algorithm used for scalar multiplication is the Montgomery-like
formulae of Stam (similar to Lopez-Dahab, projective coordinates on the
Kummer line).

Finite field arithmetic is imported from the Mpfq library. Elements are
represented as polynomials modulo t^251 + t^7 + t^4 + t^2 + 1.
Multiplication uses SSE-2 registers.
