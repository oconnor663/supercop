This implementation computes a key exchange based on CURVE2251.  
High-level code comes from the RELIC cryptographic toolkit (http://http://code.google.com/p/relic-toolkit/).
Field arithmetic requires the SSSE3 instruction set and closely follows the reference below:

Diego F. Aranha, Julio López, Darrel Hankerson: Efficient Software Implementation of Binary Field Arithmetic Using Vector Instruction Sets. LATINCRYPT 2010: 144-161
