This implementation computes a key exchange based on CURVE2251.  
High-level code comes from the RELIC cryptographic toolkit (http://http://code.google.com/p/relic-toolkit/).
Field arithmetic requires the AVX instruction set and closely follows a work-in-progress extended version of the reference below:
