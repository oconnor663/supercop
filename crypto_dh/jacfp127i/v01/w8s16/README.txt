This is a crypto_dh application and runs only on x86-64 architectures.

Some parts of the implementation use the multidigit arithmetic library CRYMPIX. 

The implementation uses the curve Jac1271 given by C: y^2 = x^5 + x^3 + 22815878948735825027404583632923055711*x^2 + 156787062186447996049629691229792057031*x + 112603218119107992661530155571863682108 over a finite field with 2^127-1 elements. This curve and Gaudry-Schost curve [1] are isomorphic over Fp(2^127-1).

|Jac(C)| = 16*1809251394333065553414675955050290598923508843635941313077767297801179626051.

The aim of the implementation is to show how to use Jacobian coordinates on imaginary hyperelliptic curves of genus 2. The implementation includes only the performance dependent code (general divisor doublings and additions) and does not cover all cases of addition. A real-world implementation would need to streamline the many special cases that can arise (e.g. degenerate divisors). 

This implementation references from the paper "Jacobian Coordinates on Genus 2 Curves", a joint work with Craig Costello.
