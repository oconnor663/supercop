Reverse-chronological changelog for *ntru*/ref:

Added crypto_declassify() for the rejection sampling in Streamlined NTRU
Prime key generation to work with TIMECOP.

Added support for extra sizes 953, 1013, 1277.

Added abort if crypto_stream_aes256ctr() fails. (There are some AES
implementations that never fail, but OpenSSL can fail if it runs out of
memory.)

Used CRYPTO_NAMESPACE.

Ported the NTRU LPRime software to big-endian CPUs.

Renamed Hash() as Hash_prefix().

Removed KAT support.

Removed built-in uint32_sort.c in favor of separate crypto_sort_uint32
library.

Removed built-in sha512.c, sha512.h in favor of separate
crypto_hash_sha512 library.

Removed built-in aes256ctr.c, aes256ctr.h in favor of separate
crypto_stream_aes256ctr library.

Ported Expand() to big-endian machines. Thanks to Douglas Stebila for
pointing out the portability problem.

Started from ref code submitted to round 2 of the NIST Post-Quantum
Standardization Project.
