   ntrulpr1277

This implementation is designed primarily for clarity, subject to the
following constraints:

   * The implementation is written in C. We have a separate Sage
     implementation that is considerably more concise even though it
     includes many more internal self-tests.

   * The implementation avoids data-dependent branches and array
     indices. For example, conditional swaps are computed by arithmetic
     rather than by branches.

   * The implementation avoids other C operations that often take
     variable time. For example, divisions by 3 are computed via
     multiplications and shifts.

Like the Sage implementation, this implementation does _not_ sacrifice
clarity for speed. There is a close match of function structure between
this implementation and the Sage implementation.

This implementation has been reviewed for constant-time behavior, and
has passed TIMECOP with several compiler options. However, it is
possible for other compilers and compiler options to break constant-time
behavior. Also, there are at least some platforms where multiplications
take variable time. Fixing this requires platform-specific effort; see
https://www.bearssl.org/ctmul.html and http://repository.tue.nl/800603.

This implementation passes various tests, including SUPERCOP checksums
recomputed from pure Sage code. However, this does not rule out the
possibility of bugs.
