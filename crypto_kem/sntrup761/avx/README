This implementation precompiles the top level of the "factored"
implementation and various small subroutines, while still calling
crypto_hash_sha512, crypto_sort_uint32, crypto_core_mult*, and
crypto_core_inv* by reference.

"./merge" uses the local compilers to rebuild all .s and .c files here.
In the table of subroutines inside the script, specifying a compiler as
"False" means that the subroutine is called by reference.
