This is the reference C code for the MQQ-SIG public-key signature scheme designed to provide 
ultra high speed signing in software, ultra high speed signing and verification in hardware 
and short signatures. 

The technical description of the scheme and the Intellectual Property Statement has been 
published in Cryptology ePrint Archive as Report 2010/527.

Basic properties of MQQ-SIG are:

  1. The length of the signature is n bits where n = 160, 192, 224 or 256. The number n can 
     be also bigger, (just change the constant N in mqqsig.h) but we do not provide that in 
     this SUPERCOP package and for bigger values of N the code is not fully optimized.

  2. The conjectured security level is 2^(n/2). This means that the following table can be 
     used to adequately compare MQQ-SIG with RSA and ECC measured in the current SUPERCOP
     version:
     _________________________________
     |  RSA    |    ECC   |  MQQ-SIG |
     |=========|==========|==========|
     | RSA1024 |  ECC160  |  MQQ160  |
     | RSA1536 |  ECC192  |  MQQ192  |
     | RSA2048 |  ECC224  |  MQQ224  |
     | RSA3072 |  ECC256  |  MQQ256  |
     | RSA4096 |  ECC283  |  MQQ288  |
     |         |  ECC384  |  MQQ384  |
     |         |  ECC521  |  MQQ512  |
     =================================

  3. The length of the public key is 0.75 n (1 + n (n+1)/2 ) / (8 x 1024) KBytes.

  4. The length of the private key is 2 n + 81 bytes.

  5. The verification speed is comparable to the speed of other multivariate quadratic PKCs. 
     The verification problem is highly parallelizable and can be executed on multicore systems 
     giving almost linear speedup with the number of used cores, but it is not implemented yet.

  6. In software its signing speed is in the range of 550 - 7,000 times faster than corresponding 
     RSA and ECC schemes. We note that the signing speed of MQQ-SIG is affected a lot by the 
     speed of the used hash function (currently in this implementation we use SHA-512).

  7. In this implementation we use two look-up tables that are precomputed from a part of the 
     secret key (the secret quasigroup of order 256). The total size of the look-up tables is 
     128 KBytes. For constrained environments, signing can be done without precomputed tables, 
     with a performance degradation of about 4-10 times.

  8. In hardware its signing or verification speed can be more than 10,000 times faster than 
     the corresponding RSA and ECC schemes.

  9. It is well suited for producing fast and short signatures in smart cards and RFIDs.

The C code that is provided here is mainly optimized for the operation of signing, there is a 
little optimization for the verification part and the key-generation part is not very optimized.
