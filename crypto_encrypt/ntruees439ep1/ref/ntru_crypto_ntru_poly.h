/* ntru_gen_poly
 *
 * Generates polynomials by creating for each polynomial, a list of the
 * indices of the +1 coefficients followed by a list of the indices of
 * the -1 coefficients.
 *
 * If a single polynomial is generated (non-product form), indices_counts
 * contains a single value of the total number of indices (for +1 and -1
 * comefficients combined).
 *
 * If multiple polynomials are generated (for product form), their lists of
 * indices are sequentially stored in the indices buffer.  Each byte of
 * indices_counts contains the total number of indices (for +1 and -1
 * coefficients combined) for a single polynomial, beginning with the
 * low-order byte for the first polynomial.  The high-order byte is unused.
 *
 * Returns NTRU_OK if successful.
 * Returns HASH_BAD_ALG if the algorithm is not supported.
